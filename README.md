Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order.Waterfall works well with teams that do not require constant collaboration while Agile is best suited for teams that can collaborate face to face.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for code writing and implementation of software solutions. A Quality Assurance Engineer is in charge  of ensuring the quality of the Software by designing and executing test plan. A Project Manager is the one that oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are software suites for writing, debugging, and testing codes.Examples are Eclipse and Visual Studio. Version Control Systems are used for tracking changes in source code as well as work coordination among team members  Examples are Subversion and Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges faced by software engineers include changing requirements, tight deadlines as well as technical debt.To overcome these challenges, the following strategies are required:effective communication, Agile methodologies, regular reassessment of timelines and goals, and task prioritisation.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is a fundamental software development strategyÂ where individual code units (functions, methods, classes) are isolated and tested independently.
Integration testing is the testing of interactions between components and subsystems.
System testing is the testing of the whole software system.
Acceptance testing is the testing of the Software against user requirements to ensure that it meets the needs of the users.
Testing is very important as it ensures early detection and fixing of defects during the development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering entails the art of crafting statements or questions to get the best responses from AI models  

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:What's the benefits of exercise?
Improved prompt:What are the physiological and psychological benefits of incorporating regular cardiovascular exercise into a weekly routine, and how does it enhance overall well-being?
The improved prompt is specific, concise and in context.
